# Python-scripts-for-Glyphs

- Place anchors in all masters

This little Python script will add _top anchors to all selected (mark) glyphs at the coordinates specified in each master listed. Adapt anchor names, coordinates and master names as required.


- Zero width

This one is to zero the width of all layers of selected glyphs (use for nonspacing marks).
